## Product & Sprint Backlog
- **Product Backlog Definition**
	- List of user requirements often expressed as User Stories (US) ordered by priority.
	- Reflects customer needs. It is owned and managed by the PO. 
	- Evolves over time as new requirements emerge or priorities change.
- **Product Backlog Contents**
	- **Description** (card format)
		- Description of the functionality in terms of the value it brings to the user.
		- Includes:
			- As a [role] I want [feature] for [value].
			- Acceptance criteria to know when it is considered complete (requirements).
			- Conversations with PO for further details.
		- Other US: Epic or technical
	- **Priority**
	- **Value and effort estimate**
		- Estimated by the development team.
		- Metrics used are usually story points or working days, but fictional may also be used.
		- Techniques like using Fibonacci numbers are used.
- **Sprint Backlog**
	- Each sprint the team moves some US from the product backlog to the sprint backlog.
	- Chosen by highest priority first, but they may decide to change order.
	- One US can be divided into several sprint tasks.
