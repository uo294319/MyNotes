## Introduction
- Definition
	- Algorithm to learn the interests and preferences of consumers
	- The objective is to make recommendations tailored to that consumers tastes.
- Connect users and items
	- Manages large amounts of information
		- Collaborative filters. Feedback from users (implicit or explicit)
		- Content-based. Item characteristics
	- Act as sales assistants.
- Goals
	- Retrieve information. Suggest the correct proposals
	- Recommendation diversity (serendipity)
	- Long tail. Graph popularity-products
## Collaborative filters
- Wisdom of the crowd to make recommendations.
	- Users rate items in a catalogue implicitly or explicitly.
	- Customers with similar tastes in the past are assumed to have similar tastes in the future.
- Methodologies
	- Neighbourhood.
		- Compute similarity to make predictions.
			- user-user.
				- Correlation between users and mean for all items for each user.
				- Memory-based method. Not scalable to real world.
			- item-item.
				- Correlation between items and mean for all users for each item. 
				- Based on a model learned offline to make predictions.
				- Do not suffer from cold start. New users
		- We should include a threshold of similarity so no all neighboards are used.
		- Usually most of the items are not scored. We try to predict them.
		- Do not have a loss function to minimize. Not clear purpose.
