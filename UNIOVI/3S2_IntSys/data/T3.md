## Definition
> **Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that studies statistical algorithms that can learn from data to perform tasks without explicit instructions.
## ML Problems
- Supervised (classes)
	- Classification (discrete values)
	- Regression (continuous values)
	- Ranking (order)
- Unsupervised (No classes)
- Dimensionality reduction
## Mathematical definition
- Given a dataset $S = \{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}$
- Where
	- $X$ is the input $x_i \in X$ 
	- $Y$ is the output (classes) $y_i \in Y$ 
- We try to find $h: X \to Y$
- Such that we minimise the loss for all test sets $S'$.
	- Classific
