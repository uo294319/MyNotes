## Discrete
- N-Hot
	- Used to represent text as a Vector Space Model (VSM)
	- We have a Bag of Words (BoW) with all the possible discrete values.
	- For each feature we have a VSM with 1 if the discrete value appears or 0 otherwise.
	- Proximity $cos(A, B)$
	- Disadvantages. Loss word importance and order.
