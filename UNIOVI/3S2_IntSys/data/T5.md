## Graph search
- Is a problem where we find a route or path from one point to another.
- Example:
	- Route in map
	- 8-puzzle
	- Robotic Assembly
	- 8-queens problem
	- Planning
	- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Performance metrics
	- Completeness
	- Optimality
	- Time and space complexity
- Tree algorithm
	- Breath first (horizontal movement first)
	- Uniform cost (expands with the lowest path cost)
	- Depth first (vertical movement first)
	- Backtracking
