## Graph search
### Introduction
- Is a problem where we find a route or path from one point to another.
- Example:
	- Route in map
	- 8-puzzle
	- Robotic Assembly
	- 8-queens problem
	- Planning
	- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Performance metrics
	- Completeness (find a solution if exists)
	- Optimality (find best solution)
	- Time and space complexity
- Types
	- Trees
	- Graphs
### Uninformed algorithms
- Breath first (horizontal movement first)
- Uniform cost (Breath first but expands with the lowest path cost)
- Depth first (vertical movement first)
- Backtracking (Depth first but only one successor at a time)
### Informed A* Algorithm
- We have the evaluation function $f$ that estimates the cost.
	- A* Search. $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$
		- Where $g$ is the cost of the path from the start to $n$
		- Where $g$ is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from n to goal.
- We explore always first the less cost choice.
