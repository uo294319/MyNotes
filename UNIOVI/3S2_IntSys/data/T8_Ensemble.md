## Ensemble Methods
- Is a method to improve performance of weak learners.
- Wisdom of the crowd.
	- Instead of using an only weak learner (classification trees)
		- Use several ones to create a strong learner.
		- We aggregate them to ensure lower variance.
	- To ensure different outcomes we get different subsets of the data
	- Choose the majority voting class or the average of results.
