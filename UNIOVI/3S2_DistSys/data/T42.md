## Introduction
- Why is it difficult to coordinate distributed systems?
	- Similar to multi-thread applications but without shared resources (semaphores or locks).
	- They coordinate through the network.
	- Nodes can fail separately. Impossible to differentiate from network delay.
- Coordination cases:
	- **Mutual exclusion** in access to resources.
	- **Election algorithms**. Nodes vote to choose a temporal leader or broker.
	- **Multicast** in groups of processes (only with point-to-point, not in UDP)
	- **Consensus**. System-wide decisions. Not only data but sequence of operations.
