## Introduction
- **Objective:**
    - Decouples distributed components for asynchronous communication.
    - Eliminates the need for simultaneous sender-receiver interaction.
- **Comparison with Other Communication Methods:**
    - **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** Requires synchronous connection; failure occurs if one endpoint is inactive.
    - **MOM:** Functions like email or messaging apps (WhatsApp, SMS) allowing delayed responses.
- **Advantages of MOM:**
    - **Flexibility:** Enables new architectural patterns.
    - **Producer-Consumer Model:**
        - **Producer:** Sends messages to MOM.
        - **Consumer:** Processes received messages.
        - MOM can act as a load balancer by distributing tasks efficiently.
