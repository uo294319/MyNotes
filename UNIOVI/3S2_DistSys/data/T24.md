## Introduction
- **Objective:**
    - Decouples distributed components for asynchronous communication.
    - Eliminates the need for simultaneous sender-receiver interaction.
- **Comparison:**
    - **RPC:** Both endpoints need to be active (synchronous). Like a phone call.
    - **MOM:** Communication in turns, only one needs to be active. Like an email.
- **Advantages of MOM:**
    - **Flexibility:** Enables new architectural patterns.
    - **Producer-Consumer Model:**
        - **Producer:** Sends messages to MOM.
        - **Consumer:** Processes received messages.
        - MOM can act as a load balancer by distributing tasks efficiently.
## Broker concept
- **Definition:**
	- Intermediary componentÂ that stores and distributes the messages in MOM.
	- Can be either centralised or distributed.
- **Functions:**
	1. Transform information.
		- Group several messages according to some criteria
		- Split large messages into several sub-messages.
	2. Route information
		- Direct messages to the appropriate destinations.
		- In distributed brokers they need to communicate between them.
	3. Distribution patters implementation
		- Point-to-point (queues for specific consumers)
		- Subscriptions. (queues for topics)
		- Broadcast
	4. Message persistence
		- Stores messages in machines file system.
		- Many messaging systems are also databases.
- Advantages
	- Reduce direct connections from $N^2$ - N to $2N$.
