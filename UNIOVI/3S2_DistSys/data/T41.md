## How a computer knows what time it is
- Several quartz clocks. For example the one for the CPU clock signal.
- To measure passage of time a quartz crystal (piezoelectric) is used.
	- The cristal oscillates (Current = deformed shape, deformed shape = current)
- Steps:
	1. Counter register measures cristal osculations.
	2. When threshold is reached, it generates a hardware interrupt.
	3. Interrupt counter is updated.
	4. Interrupt counter is compared to the boot time.
- Ways of knowing the boot time.
	- Ask user (early PCs)
	- BIOS clock (requires a battery)
	- Over the network (NTP - Network Time Protocol)
