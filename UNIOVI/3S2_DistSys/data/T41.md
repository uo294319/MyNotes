## How a computer knows what time it is
- Several quartz clocks. For example the one for the CPU clock signal.
- To measure passage of time a quartz crystal (piezoelectric) is used.
	- The cristal oscillates (Current = deformed shape, deformed shape = current)
- Steps:
	1. Counter register measures crystal osculations. (slightly different between crystals)
	2. When threshold is reached, it generates a hardware interrupt.
	3. Interrupt counter is updated.
	4. Interrupt counter is compared to the boot time.
- Ways of knowing the boot time.
	- Ask user (early PCs)
	- BIOS clock (requires a battery)
	- Over the network (NTP - Network Time Protocol)
- More precise time?
	- Have a radio receiver to receive time signal generated by atomic clocks.
	- Incorporate GPS.
## Synchronization of physical clocks
### Synchronization frequency
- Defining a perfect clock with: $C(t) = t \implies C' = 1$
	- If $C' > 1$ the clock goes forward and if $C' < 1$ it goes backward.
- So we know how far from the exact clock. Drift ratio $= C' - 1$
	- Manufacturers provide a maximum drift ratio: $C' = 1 \pm ρ$
	- So if $\Delta$ time has passed the maximum difference is: $2ρ\Delta$
- Discrepancy smaller than $
