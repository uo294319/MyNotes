## Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
- Is a key-value data structure (Also called Map or dictionary) stored in a distributed manner.
### Overlay Network Creation
1. Each node has a Global Unique Identifier (GUI) that is 160 bit to avoid collisions.
	1. Random GUI.
	2. GUI generated from hashing two items such as generation time and MAC address.
2. We arrange the nodes in a circle ordered by its GUI.
	1. Some of the nodes could be inactive resulting in gaps.
	2. We assume we can calculate next active node.
3. Each node stores some key-value pairs of the DHT
	1. Each node will store the key-value pairs whose hashed key matches its GUI.
	2. As some nodes are inactive, active nodes store the pairs of the inactive ones behind them.
4. Finger list.
	1. Each node will know (the IPs of) some other nodes.
	2. Usually, a fixed rule that is to store the nodes at a distance $2^i$ with $i = 1, 2, 3 ...$
