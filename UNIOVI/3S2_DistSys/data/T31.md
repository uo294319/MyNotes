## Architectures
### Introduction
- Focus on:
	- how to place software components on different computers.
	- How these components relate to each other.
- Types elements
	- Components. Units with well-defined purpose which can be replaced by others.
	- Connectors. Middleware that acts as intermediary between components.
### Architectural Styles
- Layered architectures
	- Components are isolated in layers (like TCP/IP).
	- Each layer can only interact with other immediate upper or lower layer.
	- Usually low-level (closest to hardware) to high-level (most abstract)
- Object-based architectures
	- Components are isolated in objects.
- Event-based architectures
- Data-centric architectures
