## Architectures
### Introduction
- Focus on:
	- how to place software components on different computers.
	- How these components relate to each other.
- Types elements
	- Components. Units with well-defined purpose which can be replaced by others.
	- Connectors. Middleware that acts as intermediary between components.
### Architectural Styles
- **Layered architectures**
	- Components are isolated in layers (like TCP/IP).
	- Each layer can only interact with other immediate upper or lower layer.
	- Software typically: low-level (closest to hardware) to high-level (most abstract)
	- Typical DS layers: platform, middleware and applications/services
- **Object-based architectures**
	- Components are isolated in objects.
	- Any object can call any function or method exposed by others.
	- Calls are performed with a client-server paradigm (synchronous).
- **Event-based architectures**
	- Intermediary called *Event Bus* where components can generate and react to events.
	- Weakly coupled (easily replaceable components) = Fault tolerant and scalable.
	- Example. *Publisher/subscriber* model.
	- Usually supported in MOM.
- **Data-centric architectures**
	- Indirect communications through a passive data store (distributed file systems like NFS).
	- Similar to event-based. Two ways:
		- Polling (frequent reading) to the data store. Example. GitHub
		- Shared Data Space if combined with events.
			- Data store is able to notify components when there is new data.
			- Examples.
				- Cloud. Dropbox or OneDrive.
				- Databases with reporting capabilities. Redis or MongoDB.
### System Architectures
- **Centralized**
- **Decentralized**
