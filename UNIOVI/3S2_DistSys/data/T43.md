## Introduction
- Threats
	- Interception or leakage. Unauthorised access to a service or data.
	- Interruption. Service or data is no longer available.
	- Modification. Data is modified or a service altered so it does not work as it should.
	- Manufacturing. New data or new activity in a service that should not be there appears.
- Mechanisms to force compliance with the security policies.
	- Cryptography
	- Authorization (access control)
	- Authentication
	- Auditing (Accounting)
- Cryptography
	- Phases
		- Encryption or encoding
		- Decryption or decoding
	- Ways
		- Primitive algorithms were based on the secrecy of the algorithm.
		- Modern algorithms are based on a cryptographic key (long sequence of bits).
	- Types of algorithms
		- Symmetric key.
			- Use the same (symmetric) key for both encryption and
