## Server Characteristics
### High Computational Power
- **CPU**
	- **Server Processor Families**: Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC
	- **Improvements**:
		- More # of cores per proc.
		- Multiple procs work collaborativelly.
		- Bigger cache memory.
		- Bigger RAM sizes.
	- **Categories**: Entry level / Mid-range / High-end
- **RAM Memory**
	- **Technology**: DDR5
	- **Physical implementation**: DIMM DDR5
	- **Improvements**:
		- Motherboard with large # DIMM sockets.
		- DIMM sockets support for high capacity modules.
- **Storage**
	- RAID and SSDs for better performance.
### High storage capacity
- **Multi-bay design**:
	- **Drive bay:** Space of standardised size to host a hardware device.
	- **Disk bay sizes**: 2,5" (SFF) or 3,5" (LFF)
- **Connection**: SAS RAID controllers with SAS expanders.
### High Availability
- **Reliability**
	- Probability that a component works correctly $t$ time
	- C
	- Calculated with the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
	- Calculated as (include leap years):
		$$Reliability =e^\frac{-t}{MTBF}$$
	- The Failure Rate is $1 - Reliability$ 
	- Standard Metric: Annualised Failure Rate ($t = 8766$)
