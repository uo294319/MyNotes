## High Computational Power
- **CPU**
	- **Server Processor Families**: Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC
	- **Improvements**:
		- More # of cores per proc.
		- Multiple procs work collaborativelly.
		- Bigger cache memory.
		- Bigger RAM sizes.
	- **Categories**: Entry level / Mid-range / High-end
- **RAM Memory**
	- **Technology**: DDR5
	- **Physical implementation**: DIMM DDR5
	- **Improvements**:
		- Motherboard with large # DIMM sockets.
		- DIMM sockets support for high capacity modules.
- **Storage**
	- RAID and SSDs for better performance.
### High storage capacity
- **Multi-bay design**:
	- **Drive bay:** Space of standardised size to host a hardware device.
	- **Disk bay sizes**: 2,5" (SFF) or 3,5" (LFF)
- **Connection**: SAS RAID controllers with SAS expanders.

## High Availability
### Reliability
- **Definition**: Probability that a component works correctly $t$ time
- **Calculations**:
		$$Reliability =e^\frac{-t}{MTBF}$$
	- MTBF = Mean Time Between Failures
	- $t$ shall include the leap years (or a portion of it)
	- The Failure Rate is $1 - Reliability$ 
	- Standard Metric: Annualised Failure Rate ($t = 8766$)
- **Problematic Components**:
	- Electro-mechanical characteristics and moving parts.
	- HDDs, PSU and fans.
- **RAM Reliability**
	- Types or errors: hard (hardware failures) or soft (electrical disturbances)
	- Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM
		- Basic ECC:  1b correction and 2b detection per 64b block
		- 8b checksum per 64b block
			- Done by the motherboard Error Detection and Correction Circuit (EDAC)
	- Implemented in every server very but low cost
### Component redundancy
- If a component fails, the server continue operating with a backup component.
